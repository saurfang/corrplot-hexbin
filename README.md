angular-d3-hexbin
========

An attempt to use D3 Hexbin Plugin and Angular.js to create interactive Hexbin plot for data exploration. 
In addition, this also includes an attempt using HTML table (ng-table) to create correlation Heatmap.

Eventually, I want to encapsulate the Hexbin into a reusable Angular directive.
