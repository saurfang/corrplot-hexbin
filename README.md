angular-d3-hexbin
========

An attempt to use [D3 Hexbin Plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) and Angular.js 
to create interactive Hexbin plot for data exploration. 

In addition, this also includes an attempt using [ng-table](https://github.com/esvit/ng-table) to create correlation Heatmap.

Eventually, the Hexbin part will be encapsulated into a reusable Angular directive.
